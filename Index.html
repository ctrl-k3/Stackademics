                        I am very excited to be joining everyone else in this journey in learning how to code. I currently 
                        live in California and happy to be catching up with everyone. I hope to be able to join the 
                        next live session. I have been watching the videos on youtube so far, and have learned much. The breakdown of how
                        the web works was great, and easy to follow though. 
                        <ins>Thanks Sunil!</ins>
